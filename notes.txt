Why are we using the react query ?
Ans.. We are using the react query just beecz 
thr main part is to fetch data and cache data.
React Query provides several key benefits for our application:

1. Automatic Background Updates
- Handles data refetching in the background
- Keeps UI in sync with server data
- Manages cache invalidation and updates

2. Caching & State Management 
- Built-in caching mechanism reduces API calls
- Maintains loading/error states automatically
- Deduplicates multiple requests for same data
- Configurable cache time and stale time

3. Optimistic Updates
- Allows updating UI before server response
- Rolls back changes if request fails
- Provides better UX with instant feedback

4. Server State Management
- Separates server state from client state
- Handles complex async data flows
- Manages pagination, infinite scroll etc.

5. Developer Experience
- Hooks based API (useQuery, useMutation)
- DevTools for debugging
- TypeScript support
- Minimal boilerplate code

In our codebase, we use it for:
- Fetching workspace folders (useQueryData)
- Handling folder mutations (useMutationData) 
- Managing optimistic updates for folder renames
- Maintaining loading states during API calls


useQuery = Get Data with a query Key 

useMutation = Update Data
what is useMutation and wwhy we use it ?
Ans. useMutation is a hook that allows us to update data in our application.

useMutuationState = get the latest opyimistic values data that was  sennt into the mutate functiion when it was called using the use mututation hook
