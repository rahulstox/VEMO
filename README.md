The Problem
In today's fast-paced business environment, traditional text-based communication is often inefficient, leading to misinterpretations, delayed feedback, and lost opportunities. While video messaging is a powerful alternative, existing solutions can be clunky. They might rely on unstable third-party libraries, lack real-time engagement features, or are too complex to integrate seamlessly into daily workflows.

The Solution: VEMO
VEMO addresses these challenges head-on. It's a streamlined, high-quality video messaging platform that empowers users to record, share, and manage video content effortlessly. By integrating real-time recording, AI-powered summaries, and intuitive collaboration tools, VEMO enhances business communication, boosts outreach, and drives productivity.

üèõÔ∏è System Architecture
VEMO operates as a cohesive system with three core components:

Record: The Electron Desktop App captures the user's screen, camera, and audio.

Process: The app streams the recording in real-time to the Express.js Server, which processes the video, stores it, and prepares it for streaming.

Collaborate: The Next.js Web App is notified of the new video, allowing the user and their team to immediately view, share, and collaborate on the content.

This project is split into three repositories to maintain a clean separation of concerns:

üåê VEMO Web App: The Next.js frontend for video management and collaboration.

üíª VEMO Desktop App: The Electron.js app for screen recording.

‚öôÔ∏è VEMO Server: The Express.js backend for video processing.
